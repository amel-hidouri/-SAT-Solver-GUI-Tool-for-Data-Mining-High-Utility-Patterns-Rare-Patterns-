SAT Solver GUI Tool for Data Mining (High Utility and Rare Patterns)

This project provides a graphical user interface (GUI) for running SAT solvers to mine high-utility and rare patterns from transactional datasets. 
The tool supports several approaches, including the mining of classical, maximal, minimal, Top-k, frequent, and locally frequent itemsets, and also supports minimal rare itemset mining.
The code is available at [this link]().
